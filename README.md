For example, if your files are in a directory structure like **`Singleton_pattern/MyApp.java`** and **`Singleton_pattern/ConfigurationManager.java`**, ensure that your terminal is positioned at the directory containing the **`Singleton_pattern`** folder when you compile and run the code.

Compile and run your application using the following commands:

```bash
javac Singleton_pattern/MyApp.java Singleton_pattern/ConfigurationManager.java
java Singleton_pattern.MyApp

```

This assumes your terminal is positioned at the parent directory containing the **`Singleton_pattern`** folder. If you encounter any issues, ensure that your terminal is in the correct directory and that your file and package names are consistent.
